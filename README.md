# Route-Planner
In this project, I have built a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps 
to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
I have used A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.

////// .ipynb files sometimes behave strange. They don't open and show, " something went wrong. Reload? " Opening the file in
new tap most of the time solves the problem.
